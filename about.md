Hello.

I'm a PhD candidate in the the Centre for Cryptocurrency Research and Engineering at Imperial College London and one of the co-founders of the stablecoin Gyroscope. 

My research is at the intersection of computer science and economics, particularly focused on cryptoeconomic theory, simulations and stress-testing.

I have an MPhil in Economics Research from Cambridge University, a First in Philosophy, Politics and Economics from Warwick University.

You can reach me at ljfgudgeon@gmail.com.
