Hello.

I'm a PhD candidate in the computer science department at Imperial College London.
My research is at the intersection of computer science and economics, particularly focused on cryptoeconomic theory, simulations and stress-testing. 

Before starting my PhD, I worked in an economics consultancy. I have an MPhil in Economics Research from Cambridge University, and a First in Philosophy, Politics and Economics from Warwick University.
