<p>
I'm a PhD candidate in the computer science department at Imperial College London.
My research is at the intersection of computer science and economics, particularly focused on cryptoeconomic theory and economic simulations and stress-testing. 
</p>

<p>
Before starting my PhD, I worked in an economics consultancy. I have an MPhil in Economics Research from Cambridge University. 
</p>

<p>
I'm sometimes available for freelance work - email me.
